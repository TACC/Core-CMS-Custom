### Create a New Project

Follow steps in [Create a New Project](./develop-project.md#create-a-new-project).

<details><summary>Reminders</summary>

1. From [Core CMS Resources] `/taccsite_custom/custom_project_dir`.
    To `/custom_project_dir/src/taccsite_custom/custom_project_dir`.

2. From `/taccsite_custom/custom_project_dir/settings_custom.py`.
    To `/custom_project_dir/src/taccsite_cms/settings_custom.py`.

3. The name `custom_project_dir` **must** use underscores (**not** dashes),
    because a valid Python application uses underscores.

### Known Gotchas

#### Old Custom Templates Directory

**If** the custom project directory:

- **both** had a name with dashes in [Core CMS Resources]
- **and** has `templates/standard.html` or `templates/fullwidth.html`

Then:

1. Copy the templates to become placeholders:
    - from `taccsite_custom/custom_project_dir/templates`
    - to `taccsite_custom/custom_project_dir/templates`

    > **Warning**
    > The name `custom_project_dir` **must** match the old name as it was, including dashes.
2. Edit the placeholder templates to extend the new templates e.g.

    ```django
    {% extends "custom_project_dir/templates/standard.html" %}
    ```

#### Expects CSS Build Step

**If** the custom project directory expects CSS build step e.g. has

- `css/src/*.css` with `@import` of a `@tacc/core-styles/` path

Then:

1. Contact https://github.com/wesleyboar.

> **Note**
> Those imports assume:
>
> - Node
> - NPM package `@tacc/core-styles`
> - a CSS build script
>
> Whether to support those here, and how to port without support for those, has not been decided.

#### Expects CSS Concatenation

**If** the custom project directory expects CSS concatenation e.g. has

- `css/src/*.css` with `@import` of a relative path

Then:

1. Rename import paths appended with comment `Core-CMS:/taccsite_cms/â€¦/`:
    - from `**/*.css`
    - to `/static/site_cms/css/build/*.css`
2. Rename relative import paths (e.g. `./**/*.css`):
    - from `**/*.css`
    - to `/static/custom_project_dir/css/**/*.css`
3. Add UI test steps to initial deploy of ported custom project.

#### Expects CSS

**If** the custom project directory expects any CSS at all i.e. has

- a template with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static`

Then:

1. Move CSS tree:
    - from `.../custom_project_dir/static/css/src/`
    - to `.../custom_project_dir/static/css/`
2. Rename `href` paths:
    - from `custom_project_dir/css/build/**/*.css`
    - to `custom_project_dir/css/**/*.css`
3. Add UI test steps to initial deploy of ported custom project.
