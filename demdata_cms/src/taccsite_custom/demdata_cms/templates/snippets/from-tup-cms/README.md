# CSS Snippets from TUP CMS

All of these templates came from the content of many snippets on https://dev.tup.tacc.utexas.edu.

They are snippets, because Frontend development is progressing, and changing, too fast to implement code in Core Styles and Core CMS immediately.

The snippets come from https://github.com/TACC/tup-ui/pull/174 and are a short-term solution. They are cloned to demdata-cms, because demdata CMS image is built off a branch of Core CMS used by TUP CMS and future CMS. These styles are not in that, nor any, image.

> ‼️ When these snippets are migrated to Core CMS and Core Styles, remove them from here!
