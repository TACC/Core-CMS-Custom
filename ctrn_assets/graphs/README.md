# CTRN Graph Clones

This directory contains clones of the graphs that are used in the CTRN.

They are deployed to https://tacc.github.io/Core-CMS-Custom/ctrn_assets/graphs/index.html by @wesleyboar.

They were created by saving live HTML and assets from [ctrn-portal](https://ctrn-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/) e.g.

- https://ctrn-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/graphs/regions/
- https://ctrn-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/graphs/participation/
