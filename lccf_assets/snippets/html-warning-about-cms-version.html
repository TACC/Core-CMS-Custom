Since 2025-03-25, Wesley reverted Core-CMS from v4.25.4 to v4.22.0 and incrementally upgrades to learn which release causes logo to overflow header. To see current version, see comment at the top of&nbsp;<a href="/static/site_cms/css/build/core-cms.css" target="_blank">any stylesheet</a>. <strong>Bug begins with v4.24.0.</strong>
