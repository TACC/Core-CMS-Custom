# Frontera - Fonts - Archive

## `BentonSans`

[Core CMS] loads Benton Sans, but it is a newer version. Most Frontera pages use CMS v1 styles and thus CMS v1's version of BentonSans.

# [Icon-Works](http://icon-works.com/)

This icon font is **not** used now. It was used for an old System Monitor plugin, via [Core CMS], which only Frontera had. The System Monitor may still have the classname `iconworks`, but Frontera injects different icons.
