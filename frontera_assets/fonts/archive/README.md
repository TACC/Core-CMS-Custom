## `BentonSans`

[Core CMS] loads Benton Sans, but it is a newer version. Most Frontera pages use CMS v1 styles and thus CMS v1's version of BentonSans.

# [Icon-Works](http://icon-works.com/)

This icon font is assumed by the System Monitor plugin. See https://github.com/TACC/Core-CMS-Plugin-System-Monitor/issues/2.
